# BudgetApp

Created with vanilla javascript and the CSS framework, Bulma.  This app allows the user to enter in expenses based on monthly or yearly expenses.  Another great feature is that the app will countdown to the next pay day and reset your biweekly budget when the next pay day arrives. Please enjoy the app and feel free to contribute any comments, questions, features or hotfixes. 

# Future Features

- Multiple options for time frames when setting up the budget initially.
- Over/under budget to be factored in and updated once the pay day arrives.
- Alert when you're close to going below budget.
- Optional description input for tracking.
- Detailed reports of expenses being tracked.
